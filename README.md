A [mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry) mod based around a new, extremely powerful and difficult to obtain material- Antimatter.<br> The substance is so volatile it can't be stored in your core without being sealed in plastanium first! 
The mod also adds in new turrets, walls, production methods and other fun stuff.
This mod is a huge WIP, all the features are buggy, unbalanced, or not fully implemented yet.
